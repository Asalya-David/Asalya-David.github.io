        Welcome to the Exorcist clan. We are a Ghanaian based clan with a few members from Nigeria, US, Canada and Netherland.
        The clan was originally called <b><i>RipGhosts</i></b> which was created around the ending of December 2019 when codm was first lauched. Friends who were in the same school and played together decided to create it.
        Members in the clan had lots of fun playing together. There was any idea of taking part in competitions as clan, all we wanted was to release stress using the game.
        Time went on till some memebrs wanted to take the game a little more serious and by so doing take part in tournaments in order to claim prizes.
    </p>
    <p>Below is the Clan logo and Clan T-shirt of the former clan, RipGhosts</p>

    <p>This led to the creation of a new clan now called Exorcists. The old clan RipGhosts is now a junior clan of Exorcists. We could not have maintained RipGhosts to partake in tournaments and competitions due to some few issues.</p>
    <p>
        Some of these issues could have been looked down upon that would not do us any good if we really wanted to be serious as a clan. 
        Interesting thing is that members who did not make it to the newly created clan still have a chance if they show some seriousness while training in RipGhosts.
        The average age of the members in the clan is 22. There are currently about 53 members in the clan out of which 3 are females and the rest males.

        One sole identity of a clan is by its tag. It's usually termed the clan tag of that particular clan. It sees to give identity to members in the clan.
        Aside identity it also beautifies the names of the clan members when they are in a lobby together. The clan tag of Exorcists is gotten from the first three(3) of the name.
        It is simply ExO but just with special characters. Below is an image of the clan tag
